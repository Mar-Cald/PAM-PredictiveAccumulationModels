# PAM-PredictiveAccumulationModels

This project is an R/Stan-based implementation of the PAM framework, incorporating the Volatile Kalman Filter (Piray & Daw, 2020) as the Perceptual Model. 

This work is still in progress. Currently, the initial volatility (v0) is fixed at a value equal to omega, and the volatility learning rate (lambda) is set to 0.1.
